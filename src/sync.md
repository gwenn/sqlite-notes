## Resumable Bulk Update

The RBU extension is an add-on for SQLite designed for use with large SQLite database files on low-power devices at the edge of a network.

## Session

The session extension provide a mechanism for conveniently recording changes to some or all of certain tables in an SQLite database, and packaging those changes into a "changeset" or "patchset" file that can later be used to apply the same set of changes to another database with the same schema and compatible starting data. A "changeset" may also be inverted and used to "undo" a session.
